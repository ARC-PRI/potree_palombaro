# About

* Potree is a free open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large point clouds. It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/) and research projects [Harvest4D](https://harvest4d.org/), [GCD Doctoral College](https://gcd.tuwien.ac.at/) and [Superhumans](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Superhumans/).

# Credits

* The multi-res-octree algorithms used by this viewer were developed at the Vienna University of Technology by Michael Wimmer and Claus Scheiblauer as part of the [Scanopy Project](http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/).
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), the WebGL 3D rendering library on which potree is built.
* [plas.io](http://plas.io/) point cloud viewer. LAS and LAZ support have been taken from the laslaz.js implementation of plas.io. Thanks to [Uday Verma](https://twitter.com/udaykverma) and [Howard Butler](https://twitter.com/howardbutler) for this!
* [Harvest4D](https://harvest4d.org/) Potree currently runs as Master Thesis under the Harvest4D Project
* Christian Boucheny (EDL developer) and Daniel Girardeau-Montaut ([CloudCompare](http://www.danielgm.net/cc/)). The EDL shader was adapted from the CloudCompare source code!
